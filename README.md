# BynarySearch-Applications

Repository for bynary search applications, made for LEDA-UFCG studies.

Binary search is a technique that finds the position of a target value in a sorted array by dividing the search space in half. Its used when the data/input is sorted 
or when you can define a range for the answer and the function shows monotonic behavior, i.e., consistely increases or decreases. This alghoritm can be done in a recursive way or interactive way and operates in O(log N) time.

These are the binary search applications that are in this repository:
